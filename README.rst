Bitcoingraph - A Python library for exploring the Bitcoin transaction
graph.

|Build Status|

Prerequisites
-------------

Bitcoin Core setup and configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, install the current version of Bitcoin Core (v.11.1), either from
`source <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin>`__ or from a `pre-compiled
executable <https://bitcoin.org/en/download>`__.

Once installed, you'll have access to three programs: ``bitcoind`` (=
full peer), ``bitcoin-qt`` (= peer with GUI), and ``bitcoin-cli`` (RPC
command line interface). The following instructions have been tested
with ``bitcoind`` and assume you can start and run a Bitcoin Core peer
as follows:

::

    bitcoind -printtoconsole

Second, you must make sure that your bitcoin client accepts JSON-RPC
connections by modifying the `Bitcoin Core configuration
file <https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_Bitcoin#Bitcoin.conf_Configuration_File>`__
as follows:

::

    # server=1 tells Bitcoin-QT to accept JSON-RPC commands.
    server=1

    # You must set rpcuser and rpcpassword to secure the JSON-RPC api
    rpcuser=your_rpcuser
    rpcpassword=your_rpcpass

    # How many seconds bitcoin will wait for a complete RPC HTTP request.
    # after the HTTP connection is established.
    rpctimeout=30

    # Listen for RPC connections on this TCP port:
    rpcport=8332

Test whether the JSON-RPC interface is working by starting your Bitcoin
Core peer (...waiting until it finished startup...) and using the
following cURL request (with adapted username and password):

::

    curl --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getinfo", "params": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://your_rpcuser:your_rpcpass@localhost:8332/

Third, since Bitcoingraph needs to access non-wallet blockchain
transactions by their ids, you need to enable the transaction index in
the Bitcoin Core database. This can be achieved by adding the following
property to your ``bitcoin.conf``

::

    txindex=1

... and restarting your Bitcoin core peer as follows (rebuilding the
index can take a while):

::

    bitcoind -reindex

Test non-wallet transaction data access by taking an arbitrary
transaction id and issuing the following request using cURL:

::

    curl --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getrawtransaction", "params": ["110ed92f558a1e3a94976ddea5c32f030670b5c58c3cc4d857ac14d7a1547a90", 1] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://your_rpcuser:your_rpcpass@localhost:8332/

Finally, bitcoingraph also makes use of Bitcoin Core's HTTP REST
interface, which is enabled using the following parameter:

::

    bitcoind -rest

Test it using some sample block hash

::

    http://localhost:8332/rest/block/000000000000000e7ad69c72afc00dc4e05fc15ae3061c47d3591d07c09f2928.json

When you reached this point, your Bitcoin Core setup is working.
Terminate all running bitcoind instances and launch a new background
daemon with enabled REST interface

::

    bitcoind -daemon -rest

Bitcoingraph library setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bitcoingraph is being developed in Python 3.4. Make sure it is running
on your machine:

::

    python --version

Now clone Bitcoingraph...

::

    git clone https://github.com/behas/bitcoingraph.git

...test and install the Bitcoingraph library:

::

    cd bitcoingraph
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    py.test
    python setup.py install

Mac OSX specifics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running bitcoingraph on a Mac requires coreutils to be installed

::

    homebrew install coreutils

Boostrapping the underlying graph database (Neo4J)
--------------------------------------------------

bitcoingraph stores Bitcoin transactions as directed labelled graph in a
Neo4J graph database instance. This database can be bootstrapped by
loading an initial blockchain dump, performing entity computation over
the entire dump as described by `Ron and
Shamir <https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/584.pdf>`__, and ingesting it into
a running Neo4J instance.

Step 1: Create transaction dump from blockchain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bitcoingraph provides the ``bcgraph-export`` tool for exporting
transactions in a given block range from the blockchain. The following
command exports all transactions contained in block range 0 to 1000
using Neo4Js header format and separate CSV header files:

::

    bcgraph-export 0 1000 -u your_rpcuser -p your_rpcpass

The following CSV files are created (with separate header files):

-  addresses.csv: sorted list of Bitcoin addressed
-  blocks.csv: list of blocks (hash, height, timestamp)
-  transactions.csv: list of transactions (hash, coinbase/non-coinbase)
-  outputs.csv: list of transaction outputs (output key, id, value,
   script type)
-  rel\_block\_tx.csv: relationship between blocks and transactions
   (block\_hash, tx\_hash)
-  rel\_input.csv: relationship between transactions and transaction
   outputs (tx\_hash, output key)
-  rel\_output\_address.csv: relationship between outputs and addresses
   (output key, address)
-  rel\_tx\_output.csv: relationship between transactions and
   transaction outputs (tx\_hash, output key)

Step 2: Compute entities over transaction dump
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following command computes entities for a given blockchain data
dump:

::

    bcgraph-compute-entities -i blocks_0_1000

Two additional files are created:

-  entities.csv: list of entity identifiers (entity\_id)
-  rel\_address\_entity.csv: assignment of addresses to entities
   (address, entity\_id)

Step 3: Ingest pre-computed dump into Neo4J
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download and install `Neo4J <http://neo4j.com/>`__ community edition (>=
2.3.0):

::

    tar xvfz neo4j-community-2.3.0-unix.tar.gz
    export NEO4J_HOME=[PATH_TO_NEO4J_INSTALLATION]

Test Neo4J installation:

::

    $NEO4J_HOME/bin/neo4j start
    http://localhost:7474/

Install and make sure is not running and pre-existing databases are
removed:

::

    $NEO4J_HOME/bin/neo4j stop
    rm -rf $NEO4J_HOME/data/*

Switch back into the dump directory and create a new database using
Neo4J's CSV importer tool:

::

    $NEO4J_HOME/bin/neo4j-import --into $NEO4J_HOME/data/graph.db \
    --nodes:Block blocks_header.csv,blocks.csv \
    --nodes:Transaction transactions_header.csv,transactions.csv \
    --nodes:Output outputs_header.csv,outputs.csv \
    --nodes:Address addresses_header.csv,addresses.csv \
    --nodes:Entity entities.csv \
    --relationships:CONTAINS rel_block_tx_header.csv,rel_block_tx.csv \
    --relationships:OUTPUT rel_tx_output_header.csv,rel_tx_output.csv \
    --relationships:INPUT rel_input_header.csv,rel_input.csv \
    --relationships:USES rel_output_address_header.csv,rel_output_address.csv \
    --relationships:BELONGS_TO rel_address_entity.csv

Then, start the Neo4J shell...:

::

    $NEO4J_HOME/bin/neo4j-shell -path $NEO4J_HOME/data

and create the following uniquness constraints:

::

    CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (a:Address) ASSERT a.address IS UNIQUE;

    CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (o:Output) ASSERT o.txid_n IS UNIQUE;

Finally start Neo4J

::

    $NEO4J_HOME/bin/neo4j start

Step 4: Enrich transaction graph with identity information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some bitcoin addresses have associated public identity information.
Bitcoingraph provides an example script which collects information from
blockchain.info.

::

    utils/identity_information.py

The resulting CSV file can be imported into Neo4j with the Cypher
statement:

::

    LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file://<PATH>/identities.csv" AS row
    MERGE (a:Address {address: row.address})
    CREATE a-[:HAS]->(i:Identity
      {name: row.tag, link: row.link, source: "https://blockchain.info/"})

Step 5: Install Neo4J entity computation plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clone the git repository and compile from source. This requires Maven
and Java JDK to be installed.

::

    git clone https://github.com/romankarl/entity-plugin.git
    cd entity-plugin
    mvn package

Copy the JAR package into Neo4j's plugin directory.

::

    service neo4j-service stop
    cp target/entities-plugin-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar $NEO4J_HOME/plugins/
    service neo4j-service start

Step 6: Enable synchronization with Bitcoin block chain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bitcoingraph provides a synchronisation script, which reads blocks from
bitcoind and writes them into Neo4j. It is intended to be called by a
cron job which runs daily or more frequent. For performance reasons it
is no substitution for steps 1-3.

::

    bcgraph-synchronize -s localhost -u RPC_USER -p RPC_PASS -S localhost -U NEO4J_USER -P NEO4J_PASS --rest
